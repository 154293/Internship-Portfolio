# C#

In this folder there are some beginner C# exercises I've had to do to familiarize myself with it.
Coming from a weakly typed language like PHP to a strongly typed one like C# was a bit of a bumpy ride, but it works fine.
I might spend some more time learning more advanced stuff in C# down the line, but for the time being PHP will do.
