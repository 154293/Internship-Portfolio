# First Website

This was a tiny project in which every student was individually tasked to make their own website about whatever subject they wanted to.
It had to have the right semantic tags in the right places, rather than just using random divs for everything.
To see the general idea of the exercise, you can check out the 'homemade template' I made in response to first seeing the requirements.
