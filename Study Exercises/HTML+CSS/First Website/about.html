                <article>
                    <p>My name is Sven Keijzer and I'm a 22 year old student at Talland College in Alkmaar. In my free
                        time I enjoy listening to music, (unsurprisingly) playing games, watching movies, hanging out
                        with friends and some iceskating, inline skating or cycling when the weather allows it.</p>

                <h1>Music In My Life</h1>
                <article>
                    <p>I listen to music pretty much constantly. Not only is it something that's always been something I
                        can rely on no matter what mood I'm in, it is something that always felt like one of the first
                        things I developed a personal taste in. When I was younger, my mother handed me an old mp3 of
                        hers, which I used to listen to the radio with at night before going to sleep. I ended up
                        remembering songnammes and later looking them up on the PC downstairs in the livingroom. In
                        short, that's kinda how my musical journey started.</p>

                <h1>My Musical Journey</h1>
                <article>
                    <p>As I grew up, I started listening to different types of music and it kinda happened in phases.
                        Every so often, I'd stumble across a new style of music or genre that I'd be interested in and
                        I'd explore adjacent music a bit, staying in that bubble for a while until I found the next
                        thing. Of course as my range of music grew, I kept going back to stuff I used to listen to
                        earlier as well.</p>
                    <p>Often times, music is tied to the memories that I experienced in that era of my life, which I
                        think is a very powerful tool. They say that memories in general can be more easily remembered
                        with the aid of mentally linking them with a specific sense. Often times, the classic example
                        would be about how certain smells can remind you of your youth, but I actually think music is a
                        much more common one, because who doesn't listen to music, right?</p>
