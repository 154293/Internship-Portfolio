# PHP - Foodblog

In this exercise, I had to make a similar system to the last. It's not a full CRUD system, but purely for the sake of brevity.
The core of the exercise was being able to generate posts in a blog from database info. It also has a system that sorts post by most-liked.
Besides that, new posts can be added with tags, which can then be used to find other posts with those tags.
