# PHP - CRUD

This exercise contains some simple upgrades to the last. With the ability to easily edit entries from the database through a form on the site,
it is now a proper CRUD system. On the detail page of every show or movie (both of which are now in the same table and sorted through code),
you can choose to change details and save them to the database.
On the index page, there's also a new option to add a movie or show with the button that leads to a form where that can easily be done.
