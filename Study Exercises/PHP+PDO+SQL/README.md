# PHP

Here's the long-awaited PHP section!
If you've made it this far, I'm hoping the contents are interesting enough.
The exercises aren't necessarily in order of complexity, but here's the gist of it:
- Novice is very basic in-terminal programs for the sake of puzzling with the language itself.
- PDO is stuff that uses PHP Data Objects for SQL and database stuff.
- Security is just a random cipher I had to make at some point.
- Together is comprised of some random games I had to make.
- Web is PHP stuff, but ran in browser through a webpage with buttons, rather than a terminal.

PDO is personally what I'm most interested in, as it's what I have to use to get my database and leaderboard running in my personal project.
