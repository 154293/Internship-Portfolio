# PHP Web - Calculator

This exercise contains an improved version of the calculator.
It checks inputs better and tells the user when something isn't a number or when trying to divide by 0 at any point.
Besides that, it still supports the basic functions of the previous calculator, but is a lot easier to use when not using the commandline.
