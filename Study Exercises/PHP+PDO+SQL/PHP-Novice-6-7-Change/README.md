# PHP - Change

This application calculates the change in different bills and coins. It tries to give the change in the least amount of units.
This means that when '10' is the input, it will give a bill of 10 euros, rather than 2 of 5.
It tries to do this as efficiently as possible with any amount of money. It also rounds up or down to the nearest 5 cents.
When executing the code, just try giving it a number that you want to calculate the change for.
