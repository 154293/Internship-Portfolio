# PHP Web - Change

This tiny web application is an improved and adapted version of the 'change' code from earlier.
When you input how much change someone should receive, it tells you what bills and coins it consists, using the least amount of bills/coins.
The obvious major change is that it is now a lot more visual. It displays the returning money in the form of images.
I also took the liberty to shorten the code that rounded to the nearest 5 cent, by handling that right after getting the input.
