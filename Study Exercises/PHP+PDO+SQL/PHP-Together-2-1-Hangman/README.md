# Hangman

This is a small web app that allows you to play hangman in your browser.

# How to play
Open the file `index.php` to begin.  
You can choose to play with your own word, or generate a random word provided in the app.  
The goal is to guess the word within 10 turns. Letters can be guessed by pressing the buttons, any letters guessed will be displayed on the screen to prevent double guessing.  
The game is won when the word is guessed correctly, and lost when the stick figure ends up hanged.

To restart, press the *start over* button.
