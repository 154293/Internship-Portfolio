# Internship-Portfolio
This portfolio is to show a few different skills I've been working on.
I have mostly been investing time into PHP and its capabilities, but I also have some basic frontend knowledge and I've been able
to try out some other programming languages such as JS, Python and C# a tiny bit.
On those latter few languages, you'll see that my level is pretty basic so far, but I'll likely by spending more time learning
about those down the line.

The folders in the portfolio are sorted by programming language/technique used.
In the 'Study Exercises' folder, you'll find tiny programs I've had to make for my study.
In the 'Personal Project' folder, you'll find a project I've been working on in my spare time.

Should you find a README file in the folder of one of the exercises, it'll likely contain some further context and explanation
as to what the purpose and limitations of the exercise specifically were.
In the folder of my personal project, you'll also find more info on what it's for and what some of my stretchgoals are.

If there's any questions or critiques about specific pieces of code that the comments haven't been able to clear up,
feel free to ask me by reaching out through email, or bringing it up in conversation.
