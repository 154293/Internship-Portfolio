# Personal Project

This project is a proprietary leaderboard website for a game I've been playing for a while now.
The reason why I'm building it from scratch is because conventional solutions like speedrun.com wouldn't do the complexity of the categorization justice.
Previously we've been using a leaderboard that's been based on google sheets and forms.
This works to some extent, but it's kinda janky and a bit limiting.

Speedrun.com tends to be used for full-game runs, which have a relatively low amount of categories.
In my usecase, the main competitive scene competes for individual levels, of which there are 276 on the leaderboard across 2, 3 or 12 categories, depending on how you choose to divide it.

This only encompasses the first game in the franchise, which is the only one that has a leaderboard now.
Given that there's another version out there with different versions, that also deserves a leaderboard that hasn't been made yet at all.

There's also a third game on the way, so there's a ton of challenges that need to be implemented in ways that just wouldn't work on conventional alternatives.

Because of all of the above, I've taken up the task of designing a database structure around this whole thing.

# What is where?

That being said, here's how to navigate this project:
The 'external', 'pages' and 'styles' folders make up a prototype version of what the site would look like. It makes use of the colorful homemade style template and is mainly to show where everything needs to go on the site.

The 'GMA-LB' folder contains my database testing for adding and removing challenges.

The 'testzone' folder currently only contains a basic include test from a while ago.

# Roadmap and Challenges

My goals aren't time-bound because my schedule is a bit unconventional, but I do have a roadmap of steps, stretchgoals and challenges I can run into.

Since it'll be a longer and more detailed explanation, it'll have its own dedicated file.
